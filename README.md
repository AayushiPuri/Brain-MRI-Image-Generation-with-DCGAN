# Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Scans Using DC-GAN and CNN

This repository presents a deep learning-based approach for detecting brain tumors from MRI scans using a combination of **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DC-GAN)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. The goal of this project is to generate synthetic MRI images using DC-GAN to overcome the challenge of limited annotated datasets and enhance tumor classification performance using a CNN.

## Project Overview

- **DC-GAN**: Used to generate realistic synthetic MRI images, addressing the issue of limited annotated data in medical imaging.
- **CNN**: Trains on both real and synthetic MRI images to classify brain tumors, improving accuracy and robustness.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The performance is assessed using accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) to evaluate synthetic image quality.

## Key Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: The project leverages DC-GAN to generate realistic synthetic MRI images that augment the dataset for training the CNN.
- **Tumor Classification**: The CNN is trained on both real and synthetic MRI images to classify brain tumors accurately.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and the quality of synthetic images is validated using the FID score.

## Approach

1. **Data Generation Using DC-GAN**:
   - The DC-GAN is trained to generate synthetic MRI images, enhancing the dataset for tumor detection.
   - Synthetic images are combined with real MRI data to train the CNN model.

2. **Tumor Classification Using CNN**:
   - A CNN model is trained to detect and classify brain tumors based on MRI scan data.
   - The model is evaluated for tumor detection performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The synthetic images generated by DC-GAN are evaluated for their realism using the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID).
   - The CNN's tumor classification performance is validated using accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

## Results

- **Model Accuracy**: The CNN achieved significant accuracy in detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI images, leveraging both real and synthetic data.
- **Synthetic Image Quality**: The synthetic MRI images generated by DC-GAN were found to be of high quality and valuable for enhancing the CNN’s performance.

## Future Scope

- **Advanced Architectures**: Future improvements may include exploring more advanced CNN and GAN architectures for improved tumor detection.
- **Multi-modal Imaging**: Integrating additional imaging modalities, such as CT scans or PET scans, could enhance model performance.
- **Real-time Deployment**: The model could be adapted for real-time tumor detection, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
